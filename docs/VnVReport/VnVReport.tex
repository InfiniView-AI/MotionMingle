    \item[Input/Condition] Practitioner’s selection on the list of types of
      annotations.
    \item[Expected Output] A request(that reflects user’s annotation selection) from
      the client device to the server for updating the annotation configuration,
      with a log indicating the request is sent.

    \item[Type] Functional, Dynamic, Automated
    \item[Initial State] The system is running and actively connected to
      practitioners.
    \item[Input/Condition] Practitioners initiate updates to annotation
      configurations.
    \item[Expected Output] The system receives and processes the updated annotation
      configurations.
    \item[Actual Output] The server gets the request and user sees the annotation they selected.
    \item[Result] Pass
    \end{description}
  \item \label{FRT7}
    \begin{description}
    \item[Type] Functional, Dynamic, Automated
    \item[Initial State] The server is running and actively receiving annotation
      configuration updates.
    \item[Input/Condition] In a controlled test environment, the practitioner-client
      initiates the update of an annotation configuration. The update is sent to
      the server for processing.
    \item[Expected Output] The expected result is that the server correctly processes
      the received annotation configuration from the practitioner-client.
    \item[Actual Output] The server is not able to receive annotation
    configuration updates while the connection has been established.
    \item[Result] Fail
    \end{description}
  \item \label{FRT8}
    \begin{description}
    \item[Type] Functional, Dynamic, Automated
    \item[Initial State] The server has received and processed the annotation
      configuration.
    \item[Input/Condition] The server uses the received annotation configuration to
      configure machine learning pipelines.
    \item[Expected Output] The machine learning pipelines are arranged and configured
      based on the annotation configuration.
    \item[Actual Output] 
    \item[Result] 
    \end{description}
  \item \label{FRT9}
    \begin{description}
    \item[Type] Functional, Dynamic, Automated

      annotation configuration.
    \item[Expected Output] The instructor's video stream is rendered with accurate
      annotations.
    \item[Actual Output] 
    \item[Result] 
    \end{description}
  \item \label{FRT10}

      transmission.
    \item[Expected Output] The annotated video stream is transmitted to each
      practitioner-client through their established connections.
    \item[Actual Output] 
    \item[Result] 
    \end{description}
  \item \label{FRT11}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Reflection.  Please answer the following question:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
\end{enumerate}
