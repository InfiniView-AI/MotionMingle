\end{description}


\subsection{Purpose}
The aim of this Module Guide Document is to detail the architecture of modules, based on selected design principles and patterns, to clarify the project’s functionalities and the specific roles of each module.

\subsection{Design Principles}
The Module Guide Document employs principles like information hiding, high cohesion, low coupling, high fan-in, and low fan-out for breaking down modules. These principles involve identifying and securing anticipated changes.

\subsection{Design Pattern}
The project utilizes the MVC design pattern, facilitating the division of complex problems into manageable sub tasks across different modules, adhering to the separation of concerns principle.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness
of the change, the possible changes are classified into two
categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and
unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden
inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only
require changing the one module that hides the associated decision. The approach
adopted here is called design for change.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum :] \sout{Video stream sharing by practitioners might be allowed for better user communications.}\\
\rt{The application shall enable the streaming of video content from any practitioners, ensuring clear visual communication for instructional purposes.}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum :] \sout{Audio stream sharing by practitioners might be allowed for better user communications.}\\
\rt{The application shall support audio streaming capabilities for practitioners to facilitate auditory communication.}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum :] The number of annotation types available for users to choose from might change as discovered through the development process.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum :] The initial release of the application has a limited load capacity, which will need to be expanded as the application's popularity grows to accommodate a growing number of users.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum :] The exactness of annotations is subject to change, given the lack of definitive measurement standards.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum :] The application may be extended to offer native client implementation.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum :] The application may be extended to offer mobile client implementation.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum :] The application could undergo enhancements with new features based on real-world usage insights.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum :] The application might incorporate an account login system to verify the identity of instructors.
\end{description}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is
more complex. Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design
decisions at the system architecture stage can simplify the software design. If
these decision should later need to be changed, then many parts of the design
will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these
decisions will be changed.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum:] The need for specific input/output devices is expected to remain stable, given the application's primary function is to augment the instructor’s video stream with annotations.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum:]  The necessity for a stable internet connection should persist, as the application depends on HTTP requests for communication between server and client.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum:]  The application's ease of use is anticipated to remain a constant requirement, catering to its primary user base of elderly individuals.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum:] The requirement for the application to be easy to learn is expected to stay unchanged, considering its elderly user demographic.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum:] The demand for server reliability and availability is projected to be consistent, due to its critical role in the application's functionality.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum:] The system is intended to be compatible with the latest versions of Windows, Linux, and macOS.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum:] Browser compatibility is a designed feature of the system.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum:] Unauthorized modifications to the application are to be prevented.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum:] The fundamental feature of adding annotations to the video stream is not expected to change.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum:] \sout{The application's design, ensuring compliance with relevant laws, is foreseen to remain unaltered.}\\
    \rt{The application’s design will include a strategy for regular legal reviews and updates, ensuring ongoing compliance with relevant laws. This shall enable the application to adapt to and incorporate changes in legal requirements as they arise.}

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum:] \sout{The client for this project is not expected to change, as it is designed as a student capstone project with limited market potential.}\\
    \rt{The application shall be developed with a flexible architecture to accommodate potential future shifts in the client's requirements or market needs, ensuring the product remains viable and adaptable for broader deployment beyond the scope of the initial capstone project.}

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum:] The stakeholder for this project is unlikely to change, as it is a student capstone project adhering to specific course guidelines.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \sout{\uctheucnum:}] \sout{The project's schedule and budget constraints are anticipated to stay fixed, in line with the requirements of the student capstone course.}
\end{description}

\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in
the SRS. In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection
between requirements and modules is listed in Table~\ref{TblRT}.

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding''
proposed by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module
decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the
module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module will do
without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the
implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title. If the
entry is \emph{OS}, this means that the module is provided by the operating
system or by standard programming language libraries.  \emph{\progname{}} means the
module will be implemented by the \progname{} software.

Only the leaf modules in the hierarchy have to be implemented. If a dash
(\emph{--}) is shown, this means that the module is not a leaf and will not have
to be implemented.

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}

In this section, the uses hierarchy between modules is
provided. \citet{Parnas1978} said of two programs A and B that A {\em uses} B if
correct execution of B may be necessary for A to complete the task described in
its specification. That is, A {\em uses} B if there exist situations in which
the correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct
implementation of B.  Figure \ref{FigUH} illustrates the use relation between
the modules. It can be seen that the graph is a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and usable subset of the
system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler
because they use modules from the lower levels.

\subsection{Qi Shu}
I am tasked with the development and design of two client-facing pages, as well as managing the connectivity between the client and server. Our current approach is shaped by budget and time considerations.

One drawback of our current strategy, which involves using Figma for UI design and React for implementation, is that its performance falls short compared to native solutions and lack of experienced designers. With more resources at our disposal, my team and I could develop a high-performance native client application with a responsive UI. This would also allow us to conduct thorough user testing to obtain crucial feedback for enhancing the user experience.

Moreover, we could explore additional design tools and technologies to improve the application's visual appeal and functionality, such as adding animations and interactive features.
As for UI implementation, our experience with different UI tools is limited, guiding our current design choices. In terms of client-server interaction, we considered HTTP live streaming as an alternative to WebRTC due to its popularity and established status in streaming services. However, we opted for WebRTC for its ability to facilitate peer-to-peer connections and integrate client video streams, offering greater flexibility.

\subsection{Kehao Huang}
I was responsible for designing the front-end portion of the system, as well as investigating the integration of machine learning models into the video transform module. Regarding our documented design, our choice to use JavaScript together with React was driven by practicality, yet I am aware that this combination might not yield the same performance as a native video-conferencing application. With a more generous budget and timeline, I envision developing a native solution that could significantly enhance responsiveness and allow for more intensive user traffic.

Another limitation of our current design is the range of choices for annotations. As of right now, we are planning to provide two types of annotations: center of mass annotation and human pose estimation annotation. Given sufficient time, the system is likely to support a larger variety of annotation types by utilizing more existing machine learning libraries or training our own models.

\subsection{Anhao Jiao}
In our project integrating a machine learning model with a video stream, the primary limitations included constrained computational resources, which affected model complexity and processing speed, and challenges in model accuracy, scalability, and maintaining data privacy. With unlimited resources, we could enhance computational capabilities for advanced model deployment, develop more tailored and robust models, ensure scalable infrastructure for high-volume traffic, and implement superior data security measures.

Cloud-based processing has benefits such as powerful server-side processing, scalability, and potentially more advanced AI capabilities. The tradeoffs are higher latency, increased dependence on stable internet connectivity, and privacy concerns due to data transmission over the cloud.

The choice of using sockets and focusing on inter-module data efficiency was driven by the specific requirements of the project. The need for real-time processing, coupled with the necessity for different modules to interact seamlessly and use shared data effectively, made this design the most suitable. It offers a balanced approach, optimizing for immediate data processing and action, while also ensuring that computational resources are used efficiently by avoiding redundant data processing across modules.

\subsection{Qianlin Chen}
I was responsible for developing and designing the SFU module and the video transform module, key components for controlling and transforming video streams in our server system.

One limitation of our current strategy, centered around using Python with libraries like aiortc and OpenCV, is that it may not be as optimized for performance as other potential solutions. This choice was influenced by our familiarity with these tools and the immediate need to meet project deadlines. Given more resources, I would explore the integration of more performance-intensive languages like C++ for critical processing tasks. This would significantly enhance the efficiency and scalability of our modules, especially under high-load conditions.

Additionally, while our current implementation supports basic video transformations, with additional resources, I would delve into more advanced video processing techniques. This could include AI-driven transformations and augmented reality features, which would greatly enrich the user experience and broaden the application's capabilities. Another area for improvement is comprehensive testing under varied network conditions and diverse user scenarios. With more resources, implementing a thorough testing framework and conducting extensive user testing would provide invaluable insights, allowing us to fine-tune our modules for better performance and user satisfaction.

Exploring alternative technologies and protocols was also a crucial part of my role. While WebRTC was ultimately chosen for its real-time capabilities and suitability for our project's needs, alternatives like HLS or MPEG-DASH were considered. These protocols offer advantages in compatibility and established use in streaming services but don't match WebRTC's low latency and interactive capabilities.

\subsection{Xunzhou Ye}
The decision to write the backend server in Python raises concerns about efficiency, latency, scalability, and concurrent usage. Python, while versatile and widely used, may not be the optimal choice for real-time applications requiring low latency and high scalability. In hindsight, using a more performance-oriented language like C++ or Go might have been considered to address these concerns. On the other hand, the choice of Python for the backend is justified by the convenience it offers in integrating the web server with ML processing. Python has a rich ecosystem of machine learning libraries and frameworks, making it a natural fit for incorporating ML models into the platform. This decision prioritizes ease of development and integration, emphasizing the importance of seamless collaboration between the web server and ML components.

Considering alternative options, the exploration of JavaScript with Node.js for the host server introduces its own set of benefits and trade-offs. While Node.js is known for its event-driven, non-blocking architecture, which can enhance scalability, it may fall short when integrating with ML models written in Python. This limitation arises from the lack of native support for certain ML libraries in JavaScript, potentially hindering the seamless integration of ML-generated annotations.
