This project is the McMaster University Software Engineering 2023-2024 Capstone Project.

MontionMingle is an innovative online Tai-Chi learning platform. It provides a real-time 
video streaming platform as a web application for both Tai-chi instructors and practitioners. 
The instructors are able to start a training session, and stream their video captured by 
the webcam. And the practitioners are able to join the training session and watch the 
live video from the instructor. On top of that, during a training session, all users are 
able turn on real time annotations rendered on the streaming video. In the current system, 
we implemented three types of annotations, the skeleton, footwork and semantic segmentation. 
They are generated through the machine learning pipeline running on a server. These annotations 
are aimed to help practitioners understand and mimic the movement of the instructor, and 
therefore significantly improve their learning outcomes. Besides that, all of the annotations 
are user configurable. Every single practitioner are able to select their preferred annotation 
to watch, and they are able to seamlessly switch between  annotations anytime they want.
